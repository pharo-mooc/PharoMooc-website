Welcome to the Pharo Mooc (a set of videos, exercises, challenges, and miniprojects).
The Pharo Mooc is fully dubbed in french and english. It comes with subtitles in Japanese, english, french and spanish.
This web site contains all the material of this Mooc in free access. In addition, in average every 18 months the Mooc is proposed and run on the France Université Numérique platform (Even if the platform is french the mooc is run in both languages). When you participate to the mooc you get access to the quizz and the credit validation.

                <h2>About this course</h2>
                <p>If you are either a beginner or an expert in object-oriented programming, this MOOC will change the way you program with objects: come and learn or rediscover object-oriented programming with Pharo! <p>Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language in
                        the tradition of Smalltalk. It offers a unique developing
                        experience in constant interaction with live objects.
                        Pharo is elegant, fun to use and very powerful. It is very
                        easy to learn and enables to understand advanced concept
                        in a natural way. When programming in Pharo, you are
                        immersed in a world of live objects. You have immediate
                        feedback at any moment of your development on objects
                        representing web applications, code itself, graphics,
                        network.
					<a href="#about-details" data-toggle="collapse">More…</a></p>

                <div class="collapse" id="about-details">


                    <p>Pharo is also a very powerful open-source environment
                        used by companies to develop web applications.</p>

                    <p>In this MOOC, we will present more specifically Pharo’s
                        Web stack which changes the way you build web
                        applications.</p>

                    <p>In addition we will present fundamental programming
                        concepts and how Pharo uses them. We will present some
                        coding idioms and Design Patterns to better design
                        object-oriented applications. Such concepts can be applied
                        to any object-oriented programming language.</p>

                    <p>This MOOC is intended for people with a programming
                        experience but everyone motivated could follow the course
                        thanks to the numerous resources proposed. This MOOC will
                        also have an interest for computer programming teachers:
                        Pharo is a good teaching tool for object-oriented
                        programming and the course will discuss object-oriented
                        design principles (e.g. polymorphism, message sending,
                        self/super, design patterns).</p>

                    <p>Throughout this MOOC you will :</p>

                    <ul>
    <li>learn how to program in Pharo,</li>
    <li>be immersed in a live environment and live a new
                            programming experience,</li>
    <li>develop a web application to apply the different
                            aspects of Pharo presented in the course.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This MOOC will also provide a new vision of the
                        fundamental principles of object-oriented programming,
                        i.e. polymorphism and late binding.</p>

                    <p>This course lasts 7 weeks.</p>
                    <p>Each week is composed of several sequences containing a
                        video lecture, quizzes and other videos proposing
                        application exercises and programming demonstrations.</p>
                    <p>This course is proposed in french and in english.
                        Videos are in french with french and english subtitles.
                        Pdf course documents (in english only) will be available.
                        All other materials (quizzes, explanation texts…) will be
                        offered in both languages.</p>

					<h2>How to follow this MOOC?</h2>

					We propose five profiles to follow this MOOC at different speed and levels. The Mooc sequences will be tagged according to these profiles. The profiles are not exclusive: to become a pharo expert you need to start as a newbie and grow up. Of course, you can also follow the full MOOC.

					<ul>
					<li>🐥 <b>Total newbies [Newbies]</b>
						 Focus on the beginning of the lectures, you can skip the Seaside/Mongo and tinyBlog exercises. Follow the end of the Mooc but without trying to understand everything. Take it easy and spend time understanding that the system is written in itself. Focus on the navigation tools (senders and implementors).</li>

					<li>🌐 <b>Looking for Web [Web]</b>
						For those that focus on web development, we suggest to get started with the syntax (since we really love this lecture you should really watch the not implementation and sequels), then look at Teapot and Seaside/Mongo combo. From the exercise stand point, focus on tinychat and tinyblog.</li>

					<li>🎁 <b>Refresh your OO perspective [OO]</b>
						 If you want to rethink your OO perspective, pay attention that even Pharo essential libraries such as Booleans or collections are plain objects. Yes you send a message to a collection to perform a loop. Yes you send a message to a Boolean to perform a conditional.</li>

					<li>🌶 <b>Wanna be a Pharo expert [Xpert]</b>
						Well it means that you should have a look at everything. You may drop the Web and the Black Magic parts if you are in a hurry.
					</li>

					<li>🔮 <b>Looking for Black Magic [Magic]</b>
If you are interesting by really advanced notions close to black magic ;-) It explains things such as reflection, meta-classes, meta-programming, etc. that makes Pharo a unique OO language. Of course, these lectures require almost everything except the Web part.</li>
					</ul>

                            <h3>Damien Cassou</h3>
                            <p>Damien Cassou received his PhD degree
                                in Computer Science from the
                                University of Bordeaux, France. He is
                                working as associate professor (maître
                                de conférences) at the University of
                                Lille, France, and is a member of the
                                RMoD research group (Inria, CRIStAL).
                                Damien is working on dynamic
                                programming languages (most notably
                                around traits and modules) and
                                software engineering (mainly tools for
                                developers). Damien has co-organized
                                many events (including ECOOP’14 and
                                ESUG many times) and co-wrote several
                                books. Because he loves programming,
                                Damien is also an active member of the
                                Smalltalk and Emacs-Lisp communities.
                                Finally, he maintains many packages
                                for NixOS.</p>

                            <p>Luc Fabresse received his PhD in
                                computer science in 2007 from the
                                University of Montpellier 2,
                                France. He is currently an
                                associate professor in the CAR
                                research theme at Mines Douai,
                                Mines-Telecom Institute. Luc is
                                the co-author of several research
                                papers advocating the use of
                                dynamic and reflective languages
                                such as Pharo to support live
                                programming of mobile and
                                autonomous robots in an efficient
                                way. Luc's long-term vision is to
                                be able to use Jedi mind trick on
                                mobile robots ;-) Meanwhile, he
                                concretizes all his ideas (models
                                and tools) in the PhaROS platform
                                (a Pharo client for the Robotics
                                Operating System) to develop,
                                debug, test, deploy, execute and
                                benchmark robotics applications.
                                Each year, Luc gives many computer
                                science lectures and co-organizes
                                events (technical days,
                                conferences, ...). He also
                                promotes Smalltalk (ESUG board
                                member) and participates to its
                                open-source implementation Pharo.</p>
